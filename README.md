# ProjectTwo: 

## Project Overview

Becky Shaheen's “Stand Together” exemplifies the unity and collective strength of a community. It reminds me of helping each other across differences, especially the phrase “We stand as one”, which emphasizes bringing everyone (different people) together. Through the project, I hope to deliver this sense of unity - that collaboration and support are the cornerstones of overcoming challenges, both in online communities and offline neighborhoods.
