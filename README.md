# ProjectTwo: 

## Project Overview

Becky Shaheen's “Stand Together” exemplifies the unity and collective strength of a community. It reminds me of helping each other across differences, especially the phrase “We stand as one”, which emphasizes bringing everyone (different people) together. Through the project, I hope to deliver this sense of unity - that collaboration and support are the cornerstones of overcoming challenges, both in online communities and offline neighborhoods.

## Technical Overview

### Animations and Transitions

- Background circular diffusion: using sudo class “after” to create a mask and clip-path to crop the specified shape
- gather: resize the letter spacing of the elements and use the scale of the transform to achieve the zoom-in and gather effect (@keyframes)
- floatUD: achieve up and down floating, by giving different values to translateY (@keyframes)
- sink: adjust the scale and opacity to achieve the effect that the text slowly shrinks and disappears (@keyframes)
- waveEffect: adjust scale and opacity to achieve the effect of slowly zooming in and out of the text (@keyframes)
- inNout: adjust the scale so that the size of the element is normal to zoom out and then back to normal size (@keyframes)
- slideInLeft/slideInRight: adjust the values of translateX and opacity to achieve the slide-in effect (@keyframes)
